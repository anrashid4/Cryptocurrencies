# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18
For this weeks challenge, we were tasked with taking the cryptocurrency data and running some preprocessing steps. Some of these steps included using the StandardScaler from sklearn and removing certain columns that were unneccesary for the tests. After that, we reduced the data dimensions using PCA and eventually ran a K-Means test and visualized the results to a 2D as well as 3D graph. After visualizing the results, it is pretty clear that the TotalCoinsMined and TotalyCoinSupply columns needed to be adjusted in terms of their values. For example, these columns had values such as "1.00862e+09" and when they were plotted, the graph came out visually unappealing. One change I would make to the visualizing aspect is changing the column values to whole numbers instead of lengthy decimals.
